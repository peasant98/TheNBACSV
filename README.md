# The NBA CSV

A massive CSV of NBA player stats from 1950 to 2017. 24,000+ rows to see who's good... and who's bad.
Download for a deeper view into detailed statistics of a player's specific season.

**Example**: One could find the row with LeBron James' stats from 2013, such as his Minutes Played, Usage Percentage, Assists, Turnover Percentage, etc.

**Note**: Players with data from *decades* ago are likely to have more fields missing, especially in the more advanced stats categories, so be careful there. There are quite of view NaNs spread out across the data!

Also, this doesn't include the last 2017-2018 NBA season, so updates are in order!
