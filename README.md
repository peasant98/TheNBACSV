# *The* NBA CSV

A massive CSV of NBA player stats from 1950 (lots of missing values) to 2017. 24,000+ rows to see who's good... and who's bad.
Download for a deeper view into detailed statistics of a player in a certain season.

**Example**: One could find the row with LeBron James' stats from 2016, such as his Minutes Played, Usage Percentage, Assists, Turnover Percentage, etc.

**Note**: Players with data from *decades* ago are likely to have more fields missing, especially in the more advanced stats categories, so be careful there. Also, this doesn't include the last 2017-2018 NBA season, so updates are in order!
