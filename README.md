A massive CSV of NBA player stats from 1950 (lots of missing values) to 2017. 24,000+ rows to see who's good... and who's bad.
Download for a deeper view into detailed statistics of a player in a certain season.

**Example**: One could find the row with LeBron James' stats from 2016, such as his Minutes Played, Usage Percentage, Assists, Turnover 5%, etc.

**Note**: Players with data from decades ago are likely to have more fields missing, especially in the more advanced stats categories, so be careful there.
